# CppAudioPlayer

A simple and efficient audio player built with **C++** using the **SDL2** library. This project demonstrates how to load and play `.wav` audio files on a Linux environment.

This project serves as a technical exploration for future experimental art and data visualization projects involving sound.

##Features
* Loads `.wav` audio files.
* Uses SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) for audio handling.
* Compatible with Linux/Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites (Gereksinimler)
To run this project on Ubuntu, you need to install the SDL2 development library:
